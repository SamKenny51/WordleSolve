What is the best starting word for the game Wordle? In this coding project, I attempt to solve this very important problem by using set intersection to determine which words remain after a word is entered and feedback is received. 
Basic use:
  The class 'revertableSet' contains methods for determining remaining words and uses the pytrends module to recommend words. Users can use this class as is or through the play_wordle function. The intersectCharJoin method returns the probability that the right word was selected.
